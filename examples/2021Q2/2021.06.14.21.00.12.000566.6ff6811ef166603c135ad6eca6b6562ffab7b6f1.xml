    <LOG>securty/sudo: Update to 1.9.7p1

Major changes between sudo 1.9.7p1 and 1.9.7

 * Fixed an SELinux sudoedit bug when the edited temporary file
   could not be opened.  The sesh helper would still be run even
   when there are no temporary files available to install.

 * Fixed a compilation problem on FreeBSD.

 * The sudo_noexec.so file is now built as a module on all systems
   other than macOS.  This makes it possible to use other libtool
   implementations such as slibtool.  On macOS shared libraries and
   modules are not interchangeable and the version of libtool shipped
   with sudo must be used.

 * Fixed a few bugs in the getgrouplist() emulation on Solaris when
   reading from the local group file.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd that prevented periodic relay server
   connection retries from occurring in "store_first" mode.

 * Disabled the nss_search()-based getgrouplist() emulation on HP-UX
   due to a crash when the group source is set to "compat" in
   /etc/nsswitch.conf.  This is probably due to a mismatch between
   include/compat/nss_dbdefs.h and what HP-UX uses internally.  On
   HP-UX we now just cycle through groups the slow way using
   getgrent().  Bug #978.
